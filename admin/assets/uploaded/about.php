  A Training Management System is designed to be the central point of your entire training operation. It will give you the ability to manage all the aspects of your business from the system, as well as enable you to integrate all your other favourite tools into the system. In this way, you can have complete oversight of your entire training business without having to switch between lots of different tools and systems.

Being able to integrate with the tools you love like this means you are never limited by one piece of software’s functionality, and you can essentially build a customised system which reflects the way your business works. No more dealing with off-the-shelf options – now you can find a system that works around our team!

So why do you need a TMS to manage your entire training operation? Scheduling and running large amounts of courses requires a lot of organisation and coordination between all the teams in your business. You need to make sure that classes are running when they are supposed to be, that you have free classrooms, instructors, and resources when you need them, that your students are receiving all their class-related communications, that all your course details are up to date, and a hundred other things all at the same time!
